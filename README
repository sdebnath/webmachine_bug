WebMachine/MochiWeb/HTTPC bug


On HTTP 401 errors, WebMachine does not read the body of the request and sends
the error response back. This forces the connection to be closed. Problem is
that httpc by default uses HTTP/1.1 and expects the connection to be persistent.
When WebMachine closes the connection, the response headers return with
"Connection: keep-alive".  This is potentially throwing off httpc and
instead of trying to open a new connection, it exits with error. There is
definitely a race condition somewhere as a subsequent POST request to the same
inets process with a delay causes it work fine.


MochiWeb modified its code to set "Connection: closed" in the response headers
in case of force closing a "keep-alive" connection.
